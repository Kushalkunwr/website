Those purposes include industrial, communcational, manufacturing,technologies etc.Teachnologies have a lot of application in the real world. It carries a lot of positive aspects but with the positive aspects there are sdome negative aspects of technologies.As the above saying goes with time, we eventually unfold the relevant answers it has brought to life. Technology has outgrown itself in this contemporary world with solidified questions and unfeasible answers. As we turn the pages to new temporal concerns, technology is an aggregate of ways in which social groups provide themselves with the materialistic mechanism of their civilization.  As the precise definition of technology is still a controversial subject, it can be perceived as an accomplishment of scientific progress and breakthroughs. The history of technology is a turnover with incessant questions. It is assumed that when the world plunged into the two world wars, technological progress skyrocketed. With the difference of stone tools back then about nearly two million years ago to the latest inventions, technology has served its best at the table.</p>

			   <p>Even experts throughout both the developing and developed world have debated whether the advent of sophisticated modern technology has helped to enhance and improve social lives or whether the opposite had become the case. The positive impacts that technology has are possibly more than what we can imagine. As we come to the most preferred impact that technology has set out, it surely has to be a time-consuming factor. It helps in facile access to information or services. It has given comfort that mankind has ever asked to be served. Coming out to other points, technology has enabled instant communication and interaction. It has been working as an enhancement to people's social lives which has increased the feeling of proximity and closeness. It has helped people at any work and worker to connect freely without any geographical barrier. It had also helped to eradicate the fear of loneliness in our lives. Far most, if had improved quality of life and ensured safety among people. With that being said, the popularity of technology will always continue to flourish.</p>

			   <p>With everything having their sophisticated positive preference, there come their dreadful negative impacts as well.  It has been detrimental especially to the younger generation who are most easily affected by its addictive nature and which can lead to people feeling more isolated from society. The enhancement in social sites, it has reduced crucial face-to-face interactions dramatically. Through the use of such appealing mediums, people feel in touch and connected yet it can be the exact opposite i.e appalling and people may lack key social skills and the ability to communicate.  It also has a damaging effect on mental health and encourages a sedentary lifestyle.  It also brings changes in nature that can be a matter of concern in the upcoming days. Even the natural resources might fall off and get exhausted. For people, it can be an alternate for comfort but it can also create a shortage of their jobs. It can leave people with no job even while having high-level certificates. The negative consequences of technology are also a big issue which has to be looked at.</p>

			   <p>Some people may argue that technology can become detrimental over time. But we can still make a difference by promoting renewable and eco-friendly technology.  So far, technology is one of the greatest tools for mankind, however, it still has the potential to be misused. With time, it has been clear that if any nation has technological superiority, it could mean the difference between life and death. It has to ensure that it doesn't result in the destruction of our natural resources and eventually, our planet. From the arguments and examples given, the overall communication and man's sociability has been advanced enormously due to huge technological progress with time.</p>
